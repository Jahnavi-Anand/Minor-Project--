# Ecosystem of Clubs

A centralized web platform designed for college clubs and students, where club admins can manage their clubs, events, and students can browse, register, and get personalized event recommendations based on their interests.

## Features

- **Club and Event Management**: Club admins can create, update, and manage their club profiles and events.
- **Event Registration**: Students can view, register, and interact with event listings.
- **Interest-Based Recommendations**: Using hash maps, the platform recommends events and clubs to students based on their selected interest tags (e.g., coding, dance, art).
- **User Roles**: There are three roles in the platform:
  - **Club Admins**: Manage events and club profiles.
  - **Web Admins**: Oversee backend processes, including user management.
  - **Students**: Browse clubs and events, register, and interact with the platform.
- **Authentication System**: Secure user registration and login for both students and admins, implemented with JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **Responsive Design**: Currently, the platform is desktop browser-based, with plans for mobile responsiveness in future updates.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: JSP (Java Server Pages)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Other Libraries**: HashMap-based recommendation system for event suggestions

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- MongoDB Atlas account (for database)
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eco-college-clubs.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

```bash
cd eco-college-clubs
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   The project uses Maven for dependency management. If you're using an IDE, it will automatically download the necessary dependencies. Alternatively, you can run the following command:

```bash
mvn install
```

4. **Configure MongoDB**:
   - Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster.
   - Add your MongoDB connection string to `application.properties`.

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/eco-clubs
```

5. **Run the application**:

   You can run the application using the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

   Alternatively, if you're using an IDE, you can run the `EcosystemOfCollegeClubsApplication.java` class.

6. **Access the platform**:
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.
